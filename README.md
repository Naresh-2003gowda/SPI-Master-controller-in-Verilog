# SPI-Master-controller-in-Verilog
Designed an SPI Master controller in Verilog supporting Mode-0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0). Implemented FSM-based control, clock divider, and shift registers for full-duplex 8-bit data transfer. Verified functionality using a self-written testbench and EPWave waveform analysis in EDAPlayground.
